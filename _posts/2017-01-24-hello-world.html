<p>This is the first blog post for this portal. The blog is meant to tell stories about what happens here on the platform, sharing updates from the platform, as well as showcasing what other developers are up to.</p>
<p>This portal is still under development, and needs a lot more content, and testing before it is ready for prime time. Once it is launched we can keep the blog up to date, as the platform evolves.</p>
