<p>The Miami Open211 API is ready for use. The portal is fully equipped with a handful of active API paths allowing anyone to pull organizations, locations, and services from the Miami Open211 service area.</p>
<p>There is documentation, and code samples to get started, and the blog, roadmap, and other tools for staying in tune with what is happening with the platforms as we make changes.</p>
<p>The data is all Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) compliant and is the latest API implementation that follows the specification, helping make the human services more accessible and usable.</p>
<p>Please visit the support page, and stay in tune with the project using it's github repository. This is a community project so please get involved and let us know what you think.</p>
