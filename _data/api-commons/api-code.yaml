    These are the code libraries we have available for the Miami Open211 API currently. These language libraries are autogenerated using the OpenAPI on a regular basis. Pick the language that suits the resources you have available to your development team.
  footer: >-
    When we update the OpenAPI for the project we regenerate these libraries. If there is a specific lanaguage, or platform you'd like to see made available, please submit an issue on the Github repository.

    - title: /categories return CORS message
      description: >-

        different?
